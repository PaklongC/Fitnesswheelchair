## Voice API's
For our prototype we tried several API's until we made one work.
<ol>
  <li>Google Voice</li>
  <li>Jasper </li>
  <li>Sphinx </li>
  <li>Snips </li>
</ol>
To properly install voice recognition on the raspberrypi we used several tutorials for the platforms mentioned above. However the big problem is that many of these tutorials are outdated. With limited knowledge it was very difficult to implement any of these platforms. With only a little bit of raspberrypi debug skills we needed a platform that needed little setup, good documentation and good tutorials. With trial and error we settled on Snips. Snips has good documentation and using the web platform it is very easy to create custom voice lines.
<br>Be warned, we did need to downgrade our raspberrypi from Raspbian Buster to Raspbian Jessie.</b>
<br> It is possible to run Snips on later Raspbian versions however this requires a good raspberrypi debugging skills, which we did not have at the time.

### SNIPS
<b>How does it work? </b>
Snips is a service that runs serveral services such as TTS(Tekst to speech), snips_audio, ASR(Automatic speech recognition) that communicate to each other over MQTT on localhost:1883.
<br>
On the snips webplatform an assistant can be created, this assistant defines what snips is watching for and has defined intents which it will call when an intent from the user is detected. For example to start our workout session we defined the data_start intent to be triggered when the user says "Hey snips, start" or "Hey snips, begin"

When Snips detects that the user called an defined intent it will send this over MQTT.


## Implementation:


```java
//use hermes to subscribe to dialog mqqt
const{ withHermes} = require ('hermes-javascript')

  withHermes( hermes=>{
    //define
    const dialog = hermes.dialog()
    //subscribe to "froekoe:data_start" (snips intent from the voice platform)
    dialog.flow('froekoe:data_start',(msg,flow)=>{
      //log the message we get from the intent
      console.log(msg)
      flow.end()
      //send http request to the local piserver localhost/wheelie is the start request
      sendHttp('http://0.0.0.0:5000/wheelie');
      //return string to tell snips TTS what to say
      return "Starting"
    })
  })

```
