### Improvements
<ul>
  <il><b> Add more indept voice controlll </b><br>Currently we have only limited voice control implementation and to better test this feature we need to implement more options like snips connect, disconnect, status ,set workout</il>
  <il><b>Add different workout options</b><br> Currently we only have a single workout with a set distance and speed</il>
  <il><b>Improve the interaction</b><br> Currently when we start a session we are conencting to the bluetooth and setting everything up. After the workout we disconnect and save all the data. This means that when we start a workoyut we have to wait on the connecting. A better solution would be to have the connecting and disconencting seperate from the workout start and stop</il>
  <il><b>Implement data analytics</b><br> Currently our assistant is barebones and only tells if you are on track or going to slow. Although this gives basic info it does not add much value. For visualisation we only plot a speed graph and tell the average speed. The next improvement would be to use machine learning to label your data and give appropiate feedback on your session. Like at t=5 "you started to deviate a lot try to keep it more constant or slow down a bit"  </il>
  <il><b>Add extra control</b><br>Currently we have basic mobile functionality. (we can start stop and retrieve data on your phone) but an mobile app should be added to make data visualisation easy and improve user interaction because it is nice to have two ways of interacting with your fitness assistant, either by voice or by phone </il>
