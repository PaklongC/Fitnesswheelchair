## Explanation of pisever.py
We use a server so that we can start and stop programs remotely, with snips, our phone or an other LAN device.The main goal of the piserver is to start the datacollection and to return data to clients that want to have it. When data collection is started wheelie.py will start a thread that runs data collection
<br>
#start main loop (wheelie)
```python
  #what to do when a GET HTTPrequest is send to /wheelie
  @app.route('/wheelie', methods = ['GET'])
  def start_dataanalysis():
      print('Starting workout session')
      recording_on = Value('b', True)
      global Wheelie
      #call the start function on our wheelie.py script
      Wheelie.start_data_collection()
      return 'Started sub process data collection'
```
#get session index
To keep track of all the workout sessions we save a session_index.csv that keeps track of the workouts, some basic info of the workout and where the workoutdata is stored.

In turn other clients like jupyternotebook can ask the server for this index
```python
  #HTTP request listener that returns the saved index of all the workout sessions from session_index.csv
  @app.route('/getIndex', methods = ['GET'])
  def get_session_index():
      #set our index path
      indexPath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),"rpi","session_index.csv")
      try:
          #read our index and put it in an list: session_index
          with open(indexPath, 'r') as f:
              reader = csv.reader(f)
              session_index = list(reader)
              f.close()
          print("HTTP send from",indexPath,":",session_index)
      except: print("could not get session index from:",indexPath)
      #Send the session_index list as an json to the client
      return json.dumps(session_index)
```
# get session data
When this function is called we return the data of a specific session.
The server reads the specific csv file and returns it in json format to the client

```python
#HTTP request listener that returns the saved workout data
@app.route('/getSessionData', methods = ['GET'])
def get_session_data():
    #convert the optional args from the url to get the specific session name
    #if none use defaultdata.csv
    sessionFileName = request.args.get('csvName', default="defaultdata.csv", type=str)

    #set the path where we get the session data from
    sessionPath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),"rpi","data",sessionFileName)
    #open the file and convert it to a list
    with open(sessionPath, 'r') as sf:
        reader = csv.reader(sf)
        session_Data = list(reader)
        sf.close()
    #return the session data as an json to the client
    return json.dumps(session_Data)
```

# Stop wheelie
Starts a thread that stops the wheelie script

```python
#HTTP request listener that stops wheelie
@app.route('/stop', methods = ['GET'])
def stop():
    global Wheelie

    #run a thread that stops our current wheelie data collection
    thread = Thread(target=wheelie.stop_session)
    thread.start()
    return 'stopped'
```
