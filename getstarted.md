## Concept brief
<i>"Being bounded does not have to be limiting."</i> <br>
By embedding several sensors into a package/wheelchair and collecting data, rich training statistics and motivational tips can be given by analyzing the data with state-of-the-art (machine-learning) technologies.

- Collecting biometric data using a hear-sensor and a microphone.
- Collecting relevant metadata using a force- and velocity-sensor.

Combining these into relevant fitness statistics using smart technologies for live and after training statistics and tips/motivations.
