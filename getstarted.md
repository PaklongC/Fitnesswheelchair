### Mision
Providing an extensive fitness experience for athletic tech enthusiasts in wheelchairs.

#### Concept brief
<i>"Being bound does not have to be limiting."</i>
By embedding several sensors into a package/wheelchair and collecting data, rich training statistics and motivational tipa can be given by analyzing the data with state-of-the-art (machine-learning) technologies.
Collecting biometric data using a hear-sensor and a microphone.
Collecting relevant metadata using a force- and velocity-sensor.

Combining these into relevant fitness statistics using smart technologies for live and after training statistics and tips/motivations.
