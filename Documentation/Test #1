Goal: testing the IMU

<b>Introduction</b>
(
  Concept
  Using the wheelchair as a fitness-/health-tracker by embedding several different sensors into it.
  Data collected will be used to help users achieve a chosen training.

  Uncertainties
  - Core concept
  - Method of interaction

  Hypothesis
  - the speed of the wheelchair can be used to guide users through a 'trainings-mode'
    (i.e. by motivating the user to keep the speed constant for instance).
      - We foresee that the data collected will be rather 'noisy'. Through calibration
        (or any other technique) however , we expect to make the collected data usable as intended. 
  - the voice of the user and/or the voice of the computer provides a natural and pleasant
    way of interaction.
      - Although this channel of interaction might not be the most forward or effective,
        we expect this will be interpreted as most fun by the user; especially coming from
        the computer's side.

<b>Method</b>
(
  The original athletic wheelchair consist out of several different sensors and outputs.
  This prototype however will be used to validate the core concept using only two sensors and
  one actuator: respectively a microphone, an accelerometer and a speaker; providing insight
  into the feasibility of the concept technology-wise.
  The prototype will also be used to gage the (primary) way of interaction of this concept.
