<h1><b>Introduction</h1></b>

<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
Using the wheelchair as a fitness-/health-tracker by embedding several different
sensors into it. <br>
Data collected will be used to help users achieve a chosen training.

<h4>Uncertainties</h4>
<p><i><ol>
  <li>Core concept,<br></li>
  <li>Method of interaction</li>
</i></ol></p>

<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
<ul><p>
  <li>the speed of the wheelchair can be used to guide users through a
  'trainings-mode' (i.e. by motivating the user to keep the speed constant for
  instance).
  <ul>
    <li>We foresee that the data collected will be rather 'noisy'. Through
    calibration (or any other technique) however , we expect to make the
    collected data usable as intended.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>the voice of the user and/or the voice of the computer provides a natural
  and pleasant way of interaction.
  <ul>
    <li>This channel of interaction might be the most forward or effective since
    it allows hands-free control. We expect this will be interpreted as most fun
    by the user; especially coming from the computer's side.</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>


<h1><b>Method</h1></b>
<p>
The original athletic wheelchair consist out of several different sensors and
outputs.<br>
This prototype however will be used to validate the core concept using only two
sensors and one actuator: <br>
<ol>
  <li>respectively a microphone,</li>
  <li>an accelerometer </li>
  <li>and a speaker; </li>
</ol>
providing insight into the feasibility of the concept technology-wise. <br>
The prototype will also be used to gage the (primary) way of interaction of
this concept.</p>
