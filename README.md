<H8><b>WHY</b></H8>
<ul>
	  <li>Create a wheelchair that functions as a fitness tracker for the disabled by measuring their development and performances. The prototype serves to test the feasibility of one of the core features of the concept.</li>
</ul>
<H8><b>HOW</b></H8><br>
<ul>
	  <li> Testing the accelerometer and force sensor to collect meaningful data to send to the HUB.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting insight into sensor-sensitivities and accurate measurements.</li><br>
      </ul>
	  <li>Using the data during exercise with voice control.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Getting insight into the user-interaction, guided by sound.</li>
    </ul><br>
