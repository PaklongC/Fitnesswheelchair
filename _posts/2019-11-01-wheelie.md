This page contains a detailed explanation of our source code. For the full source code go to our github page.

### Explanation of wheelie.py
Wheelie.py is the main data collector of our project. with this script we collect data, send data, save data and send feedback to the user. For this explanation will will run through the code like it is ran when the piserver starts the code. To prevent the piserver progran to pause we do this in a new thread. So we can keep data collecting and listen to HTTPrequest at the same time
<br>
### start main loop (wheelie)
<br>
```python
#start our program in a seperate  thread preventing the piserver.py from going timeout
def start_data_collection():
    try:
        print('started connection & data collection thread')
        global thread
        thread = Thread(target=start_connection)
        thread.start()
    except:
        print('could not start thread')
#our setup/starting function First run setup, then connect bluetooth. After that tell user that we started and set the start times
def start_connection():
    setup()
    connect_bluetooth()
    snips_say("setup complete, Let's start rolling")
    global start_time, dcd_start_time
    start_time = time.time()
    dcd_start_time = datetime.now()
    fbm.set_start_time(start_time)
```

# Setup
We run a setup function. This declares all variables that we need on setup.

```python
#============================= Setup =====================================
#Run this first & declare all global variables
def setup():
    load_dotenv()
    global THING_ID,THING_TOKEN,BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_MAC,ADDRESS_TYPE,GATT_CHARACTERISTIC_ORIENTATION,bleAdapter
    global my_thing,my_property,csvName, dataPath
    global start_time, dcd_start_time
    global ad, distance, fbm, collecting
    collecting = True
    ADDRESS_TYPE = pygatt.BLEAddressType.random
    THING_ID = os.environ['THING_ID']
    THING_TOKEN = os.environ['THING_TOKEN']

    csvName ='defaultdata.csv'
    dataPath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),"data","defaultdata.csv")

    #bluetooth max & UUID of gatt service
    BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_MAC ="F4:36:23:1E:9E:54"
    GATT_CHARACTERISTIC_ORIENTATION ="02118833-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF"

    bleAdapter = pygatt.GATTToolBackend()
    bleAdapter.start()

    my_thing = Thing(thing_id=THING_ID, token=THING_TOKEN)
    my_thing.read()
    my_property = my_thing.find_or_create_property("Wheelchair Speed",
                                                   PropertyType.THREE_DIMENSIONS)
    start_time = time.time()
    dcd_start_time = datetime.now()

    ad = analysedata
    distance = 0
    fbm = feedbackmanager
```
# Connect to bluetooth
After the setup has ran we want to conenct to our adafruit and subscribe to the BLEGATT service. If we failed to connect we try it again. When we managed to connect we also create a csv file to store our data in.

```python
#try connecting to BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_MAC if not able to connect try again in 5 seconds
def connect_bluetooth():
    a=1
    while a:
        print('start connecting to:', BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_MAC)
        snips_say("start connection") # Tell TTS to communicate to user we are starting our connection
        try:
            global left_wheel
            #connect to our bluetooth device
            left_wheel = bleAdapter.connect(BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_MAC, address_type=ADDRESS_TYPE)
            print("Connection succesfull:" +str(BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_MAC))
            create_csv() #create our csv file  where we store our data
            a = 0

        except:
            print("whooopie daisy no connection")
            time.sleep(5)

    #subscribe to bluetooth service with UUID but first wait 2 seconds
    time.sleep(2)
    #subscribe gatt service
    try:
        print("subscribing to service")
        #subscribe to bluetooth service, when we recieve data, run: handle_orientation_data
        left_wheel.subscribe(GATT_CHARACTERISTIC_ORIENTATION,
                         callback=handle_orientation_data)
    except:
        print("could not subscribe to gatt service")
        time.sleep(5)
        left_wheel.unsubscribe(GATT_CHARACTERISTIC_ORIENTATION,wait_for_response=False)
        bleAdapter.stop()
        bleAdapter.start()
        connect_bluetooth() #try to connect again

```
# Edditing CSV
When we have connection we create a local csv file to store our data in.
And when we have data we can write to the csv with write_csv(mydata)

```python
#create our data defaultdata.csv This will overwrite the previous file
def create_csv():
    try:
        with open (dataPath,'w') as csvFile: # open in write mode 'w', we write so we will overwrite the file
            writer = csv.writer(csvFile)
            writer.writerow(['theta', 'v','darc','distance']) #add our header/index of the csv
            csvFile.close
            print('Created csv file: '+ csvName)
    except:
        print('failed to create:',csvName)
        #update our csv with data,
def write_csv(csvData):
    try:
        with open(dataPath, 'a') as csvFile: # open in append mode 'a', we will append the file (add new row to bottom)
            writer = csv.writer(csvFile)
            writer.writerow(csvData)
            csvFile.close()
    except:
        print("could not write to csv")
```
# Handle data
In our connect to bluetooth step we subscribed to a gatt_service. This service sends data from the adafruit to the pi. This script is called everytime the adafruit sends data and translates the bytes in to a data list that we can use.
<br><br>
After we recieved the data we do some small calculations and then save the data locally and send the data to the dcdhub. We  recieve de rotation velocity and distance change so we can process the data now or afterwards with only the raw data.

```python
#is called every time we get data from our bluetooth subscription
def handle_orientation_data(handle, value_bytes):
    """
    handle -- integer, characteristic read handle the data was received on
    value_bytes -- bytearray, the data returned in the notification
    """
    if(collecting):
        try:

            global ad, distance, values
            #convert our byte values to an list values[] the adafruit feather send [dRotation,dVelocity,dDistance]
            values = [float(x) for x in value_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(",")]
            values[1]= 3.6*values[1]    #speed m/s to km/h
            distance += abs(values[2]) #get the absolute dDistance we have traveled and add this to our current distance
            values.append(distance)
            print(values)
        except: print("Could not convert data")
        try: fbm.update(values) #Update the feedback manager which will give feedback when the conditions are met
        except: print("feedbackmanager failed")
        try: write_csv(values)  #save the data in a csv file
        except: print("Could not write csv")
        try: writeto_dcd(values)    #send data to the dcdhub
        except: print('Could not send data to dcdhub')
```
# Feedbackmanager
Inorder to give feedback to the user we have to see when we give feedback, what kind of feedback we want to give and then send our feedback to the snipsTTS to get our text to speech that the user can hear.
The feedbackmanager pulls data from a config.txt to know things like target speed and target distance. In our prototype this can only be changed manually but in the future the user can set these settings ofcourse.
<br><br>
To send speech lines to snips we wrote a small script that publishes our lines to snips.
<b> snipsay.py</b>
```python
from hermes_python.hermes import Hermes, MqttOptions
#simple TTS script that sends a string over mqqt localhost:1883.
#The snips platform is listening to this and when the adress (first None) is not specified it will use snips TTS say
#for more information see https://docs.snips.ai/reference/dialogue
#And https://hermespython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html
def snips_say(message):
    with Hermes(mqtt_options=MqttOptions()) as h:
    	h.publish_start_session_notification(None,message,None)
        print("Snips TTS:",message)
#snips say but with an variable as second argument
def snips_sayx(message,x):
    with Hermes(mqtt_options=MqttOptions()) as h2:
        message += str(x)
        h2.publish_start_session_notification(None,message,None)

```

# Stop workout session
This is called when the piserver gets an http request or an keyboard interrupt is done.
When we stop we want to stop collecting data, stop our connection with the adafruit, save our data and give a workout summary to the user.
