subtitle: Preliminary Idea and Prototype

## 1. Brainstorming and Preliminary idea
Three distinct product directions were found after brainstorming:
- A fitness wheel chair made for the athletic tech enthusiasts,
- a 'party' wheelchair made for entertainment/entertaining a crowd and
- a wheelchair that could tell when and which parts of it needs to be replaced or repaired.

For the scope of this project, the first direction was taken. The concept was fleshed out more to fit the market and target-group. The following assumption was taken and should be validated (using a prototype).

## 2. Assumption and validation
- Interaction with the concept is done using voice. Hands-free control is desirable for this target-group.
To get more insights, voice recognition and control will be build into the prototype for testing.

## 3. (Initial) setup and build iterations
The prototype will be build using a Feather (with sensors attached) and a Raspberry Pi (intersection of incoming and outgoing data). Communication between the Feather and Raspberry Pi will be done using bluetooth. The Raspberry Pi will use WiFi to get/put data onto a server.
