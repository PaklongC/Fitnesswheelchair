## Velocity calculation
### Acceleration
Using the IMU, when placed and calibrated correctly, the accelerometer can be used to measure the acceleration. By integrating to the time, the velocity can be calculated.
<b>Because velocity is calculated through integration, any (small) discrepancy will lead to a big deviation of the actual velocity (versus the calculated velocity). <br>
Sidenote, when the acceleration is accurately measured, placing force sensors strategically can lead to interesting force calculations.</b>

### Angle displacement
Using the gyro in the IMU sensor, the angular displacement can be measured. The velocity can then be calculated by means of differentiating.
<b>The velocity is calculated much more accurately using wheelchair-specific parameters, (relatively much more precise) gyro and differentiation.</b>

```java
for (int i = 0;i<5;i++)
{
  imu::Vector<3> orientation = bno.getVector(Adafruit_BNO055::VECTOR_EULER);
  t = BNO055_SAMPLERATE_DELAY_MS/1000.00;
  float a = (orientation.x());
  delay(BNO055_SAMPLERATE_DELAY_MS);
  imu::Vector<3> orientation2 = bno.getVector(Adafruit_BNO055::VECTOR_EULER);
  float a2 = (orientation2.x());
  float delta_a = a2-a;
  float arc = 2*3.14*r*(delta_a/360);
  float v = arc/t;
  Serial.print("Calculated speed: ");
  Serial.println(v);
}
```
