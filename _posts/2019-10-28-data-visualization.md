Data transferred through <b>FIXMEEEEE</b> can be visualized using several methods.

#### 1. D3.js
D3.js offers an extensive library with widgets, build up from several different .html-, .css-, .js-files etcetera.
Using the <i>"Simple Graph"</i> widget, combined with data transferred in a .csv-file, the following graph could be created

<b>Although many projects have successfully implemented D3.js widgets into their projects. Due to the scope of the project, we felt that the returns of using such a complex system was not efficient enough with regards to the time we had.</b>

#### 2. Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook offers a plugin where widgets can be viewed in the same 'page' it has been coded. This can be done relatively easily and quickly when the right (versions of) packages are installed. Also, by adding analytics-libraries, different statistics can be calculated and shown.

<b>This feature offers great features for the scope of this project/prototype. Although making the visualization live is more challenging, data can be visualized cleanly of one .csv-file.
Several other widgets (like a dropdown) are also available. Although visualizations are not live, several different .csv-files can be rendered when the right option is chosen from a drop-down.</b>

#### 3. DCD Hub
When connected, the DCD Hub offers easy live visualizations of data received.

<b>Getting everything going might prove troublesome at the beginning. However, the returns are great since live visualizations are still (relatively) easily established.</b>
