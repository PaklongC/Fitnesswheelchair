title: The Prototype
---

A prototype has been build to validate a couple assumptions taken during the development of the <b>wheelchair++. </b>

The developed prototype will be used to validate the feasibility of the core concept.
To get insights into the desirability of the idea, the ability to measure speed (one of the core functions of the concept) was added to the wheelchair.
Since a wheelchair-user uses his/her hands relatively more often; voice recognition and voice output were also added, as an alternate way of interacting. The assumption that this is more desirable, and the aforementioned assumption, will be validated using the prototype.

### Research questions related to the prototype
1. Is velocity a relevant measurement when it comes to collecting data from a training?  
  - <i>Getting insight into sensor-activities and measurement accuracy</i>
2. Is voice in and output desirable when it comes to control and output?  
  - <i>Getting insight into analytics</i>
